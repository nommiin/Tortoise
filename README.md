# Tortoise
A GameMaker bytecode interpreter written in GameMaker Language

## Status
Can run basic logic, loops, if statements, etc. Local and global variables are supported. It **does not** load rooms or objects. `CODE` blocks are invoked directly using `ExecuteBytecode` at the moment, for testing.

## Why?
Mostly for research purposes, I also wanted to write my first interpreter in a language I was comfortable in (which just so happened to by GML). Ideally I'll use this project to write another interpreter in a high performance language like Rust, C++, or Haxe 

## Goals
Run a game in it, probably...?
