# Miscellaneous Notes/TODO
- (the following notes/suggestions were given courtesy of YellowAfterlife)
- Change from a switch statement to a lookup table for operation scripts
- Just use least significant 16-bits of Branch instruction as the jump count
- Move away from reading the bytecode buffer and instead read the data into an array or grid
